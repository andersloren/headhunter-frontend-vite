# Headhunter

This is the new (!) frontend part of the internship project Headhunter originally created by [Anders LorÃ©n](https://github.com/andersloren) and [Mikael Engvall](https://github.com/mikaelengvall).

The ![previous frontend](https://github.com/andersloren/headhunter-frontend) was based on create-react-app. An unexpected webpack update caused me enough trouble to try out a Vite build instead.

The backend can be found [here](https://github.com/andersloren/headhunter).
