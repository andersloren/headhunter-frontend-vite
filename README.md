## Overview

This is the new (!) frontend part of the internship project Headhunter originally created by [Anders Lor√©n](https://github.com/andersloren) and [Mikael Engvall](https://github.com/mikaelengvall).

The [previous frontend](https://github.com/andersloren/headhunter-frontend) was based on create-react-app. After a recent webpack update, I decided to migrate the codebase to a Vite build for improved performance and development experience.

The backend can be found [here](https://github.com/andersloren/headhunter).
