## Purpose

## Other part of the project

The [previous frontend](https://github.com/andersloren/headhunter-frontend) was based on create-react-app. After a recent webpack update, I decided to migrate the codebase to a Vite build for improved performance and development experience.

The backend can be found [here](https://github.com/andersloren/headhunter).
